"""
Tests for activeWeightDelta — the drift-adjusted measure of what a fund
manager actually DID, as opposed to what the market did to them.

The two failure modes these lock down were both measured on real production
data (2026-07-08 -> 2026-07-09):

  * Raw weight is price-contaminated. Its sign agreed with the fund's actual
    share change only ~49% of the time, and ~55% of all "signals" came from
    rows where zero shares changed hands.
  * Raw shares are flow-contaminated. EGGY issued +2.63% creation units and
    every one of its 19 equity positions gained exactly +2.63% shares without
    the manager expressing any view at all.

activeWeightDelta must be blind to both.
